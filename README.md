 
 Dataset
 
 A dataset for ADL recognition with an accelerometer worn on the wrist was used as a training dataset for the neural network.
 
ADL(Activities of Daily Living) are everyday actions performed by a person: getting out of bed, brushing teeth, walking, climbing stairs, etc.
The data for the dataset was collected by scientists using a single three-axis accelerometer attached to the right wrist of each of the subjects.
The dataset consists of sets of signals characterizing any ADL. The signals, in turn, are three-dimensional vectors, the values of which are encoded accelerations of the accelerometer along three axes (x, y, z).

The program generates:

1)Graph of convergence of generator and discriminator errors

2)3D graph of points created by the generator and points corresponding to the present signal

3)File with generated coordinates
